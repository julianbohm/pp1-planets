                <h4>Mercury</h4>
                <p>The smallest planet in the solar system, and also the closest to the sun, is a rocky world, without
                    air and its interior hides a large metal core. The side that faces the sun is very hot, while the
                    other side, where it is at night, is freezing cold. Mercury is one of the 5 planets that can be seen
                    with the naked eye, in its case we can see it before sunrise and shortly after sunset for ancient
                    cultures its movements were fast and confusing compared to the other stars. And that is why it was
                    related to a god. In mercury the sun hides and returns and rises on the same horizon shortly after.

                <h4>Venus</h4>
                <p>The hottest planet in our solar system. Venus is the second closest planet to the sun. It rotates on
                    itself slowly and in the opposite direction to the rest of the planets, a day on Venus lasts 243
                    Earth days and a year on Venus lasts 225! Its day is longer than the year! It is a rock world with a
                    size similar to the earth, but without seas or oceans, the atmosphere of Venus is so thick that it
                    traps too much heat from the sun, so the planet heats up like a furnace and does not cool down, day
                    or night! it is so hot there the iron would melt.
