Welcome to the Our Solar System, it is a webpage that shares information with all the visitor that want to learn awesome facts about our solar system, it is also a space design to teach and show how big and special space is.

There are link to the social networks of the community as well as a form in where the visitor can leave personal information to connect with the whole community.
This webpage has been created for the first portfolio project of the full stack Software Development Diploma at the Code Institute. This first project was made using as tools only html and css language. This project was write and save using Gitpod and Github, and Gitpages to deploy the website.

![The Sun](/assets/images/sunpage.png)
The Sun page is quite self explanatory, because it is our star and the one that keep everything working togheter in our solar system, it was important to highlight this celestial object, and as an added bonus to highlight the sun separated, it can have de bigest image of the most visualy atractive object.


### Sing Up Page

 The sign up have a backgound of a stunning photo of space, and form to leave basic information with with required for every field, that has a translucid background to smoothly separate the Form from the background.  



### Features left to implement

![Contrast Colors](/assets/images/contrast%20.png)

![COntrast Colors](/assets/images/contrast%201.png) 

* 	Because of the dark background of all the images at space, it was quite difficult to fine equilibrium to avoid a too saturated and heavy palette, that is way I choose to go with light color, almost white, to create a good and clean contrast. This webpage palette was inspiring by [Nasa Web page](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/planets/).
